# Sign Language Recognition Project

My Part II project for the University of Cambridge Computer Science Tripos

# Initialisation

This current collection of scripts uses the LSA64 dataset, linked [here](https://facundoq.github.io/datasets/lsa64/). The current plan is to extract features from the BSL dict dataset, linked [here](https://github.com/gulvarol/bsldict). Further information will be added as progress continues.

This project is based on the work linked [here](https://www.sicara.fr/blog-technique/sign-language-recognition-using-mediapipe)
