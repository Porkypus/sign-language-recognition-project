# Sign Language Recognition Project

My Part II project for the University of Cambridge Computer Science Tripos

# Initialisation

This current collection of scripts uses the [LSA64](https://facundoq.github.io/datasets/lsa64/) dataset. The current plan is to extract features from the [bsldict](https://github.com/gulvarol/bsldict) dataset. Further information will be added as progress continues.

This project is based on this [work](https://www.sicara.fr/blog-technique/sign-language-recognition-using-mediapipe)
